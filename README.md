# Rotating-Camera-For-Video-Conferencing-Based-On-Speaker-Voice

## Description

The given "code.py" file was tested for 3 sensors only and the results were satisfactory, this may not work 100% accurately therefore, slight ammendments to the sensitivity of the sensors are needed to be made and tried out, hope it'll workout fine.
